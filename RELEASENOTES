0.0.10 [Nov 24, 2010]
- [BREAKING CHANGE] required_parameters to declared_parameters. So to get the 
  list of declared parameters for a method, do:

      has_named_parameters :foobar, 
        :required => :a, :optional => [ :b, :c ]
      def foobar
        declared_parameters.inspect
      end

      foobar      # => [ :a, :b, :c ]

- [INTERNAL] Parameter spec table is now retained. 

0.0.9 [Nov 24, 2010]
- [FEATURE] You can now query what parameters have been declared for a method:

      class Foo
        has_named_parameters :bar, 
          :required => :x, :optional => [ :y, :z ]
        def bar options = { }
          required_parameters.inspect
        end
        
        has_named_parameters :'self.zoo', 
          :required => :a, :optional => [ :b, :c ]
        def self.zoo
          required_parameters.inspect
        end
      end
      
      Foo.new.bar  # => [ :x, :y, :z ]
      Foo.zoo      # => [ :a, :b, :c ]
      
0.0.8 [Nov 22, 2010]
- [INTERNAL] Parameter spec will no longer be shared between singleton and 
  instance methods. Bonus performance improvement: it no longer needs to keep
  track of the parameter specs after the class is declared.
- [INTERNAL] The mode argument is no longer entertained by the requires and 
  recognizes clause. Use the has_named_parameters clause on constructors if 
  permissive behavior is required on optional parameters.

0.0.7 [Nov 18, 2010]
- [FEATURE] Added support to distinguish named parameters declaration for 
  class and instance methods that uses the same names. So now you could do:
  
      class Mailer
        has_named_parameters :send_mail, 
          :required => :to, 
          :optional => [ :from, 'yourself@example.org' ]
        def send_mail options = { }
          Mailer.send_mail options
        end

        has_named_parameters :'self.send_mail', :required => [ :to, :from ]
        def self.send_mail options = { }
          # ... do mail sending stuff here ...
        end
      end
      
- [FEATURE] Added support for requires clause.
- [FEATURE] Added support for recognizes clause.
- [FEATURE] Added support for permissive evaluation of optional parameters.
- [INTERNAL] Will now expect that the Hash args for the named parameters is 
  the last argument of the method.

0.0.6 [Nov 13, 2010]
- [FEATURE] Added support for requiring one-of from a list of named 
  parameters.
- [FEATURE] Added support for declaring default values for parameters.
- [INTERNAL] spec is now normalized inside the has_named_parameters 
  declaration allowing more flexible notation when when specifying default
  values for parameters.
- [INTERNAL] Updated tests.

0.0.5 [Nov 11, 2010]
- [BUGFIX] Same as 0.0.4 - except this time it's really fixed :-)

0.0.4 [Nov 11, 2010]
- [BUGFIX] Reported method name when ArgumentError is raised was ugly. 

0.0.3 [Nov 11, 2010]
- [FEATURE] Added support for has_named_parameter declaration for class 
  methods.

0.0.2 [Nov 10, 2010]
- [BUGFIX] ArgumentError incorrectly references Module instead of actual class
  that raised it.

0.0.1 [Nov 10, 2010]
- Initial release.

0.0.0 [Nov 10, 2010]
- Initial release. (yanked)
