0.0.7 [Nov 18, 2010]
- [FEATURE] Added support to distinguish named parameters declaration for 
  class and instance methods that uses the same names. So now you could do:
  
      class Mailer
        has_named_parameters :send_mail, 
          :required => :to, 
          :optional => [ :from, 'yourself@example.org' ]
        def send_mail options = { }
          Mailer.send_mail options
        end

        has_named_parameters :'self.send_mail', :required => [ :to, :from ]
        def self.send_mail options = { }
          # ... do mail sending stuff here ...
        end
      end
      
- [FEATURE] Added support for requires clause.
- [FEATURE] Added support for recognizes clause.

  parameters.
