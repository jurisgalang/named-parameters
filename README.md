NamedParameters Gem
===================
This gem enables (simulated) named-parameters in Ruby.

Installation
------------

    gem install named-parameters

Usage
-----    
To enable it everywhere (recommended):

    require 'named-parameters'

And all your classes should be able to declare:

    has_named_parameters :method, :optional => [ ... ], :required => [ ... ]

If you want to be selective about which classes will use it, do:

    require 'named-parameters/module'

-- then mix-in the `NamedParameters` module into the class of your choice, for
example:

    class FooBar
      include NamedParameters
      # ...
    end

Using the has_named_parameters Method
-------------------------------------
The `has_named_parameters` method is used to declare that a method accepts a
`Hash` argument that should be treated like named-parameters.

For example:

    class GoogleStorage
      has_named_parameters :initialize, :required => [ :'access-key', :'secret-key' ]
      def initialize opts = { }
        # ...
      end
      
      has_named_parameters :request, :optional => :timeout
      def request path, opts = { }
        # ...
      end
    end

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
-----------------------------
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version 
  unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have 
  your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can 
  ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
